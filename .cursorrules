## Commits
- Commit automatically when a meaningful chunk/work package is cleanly completed, without waiting for explicit user request
- This includes completing a logical unit of work, fixing a bug, implementing a feature, or making related configuration changes
- Always write clear, descriptive commit messages following Conventional Commits format
