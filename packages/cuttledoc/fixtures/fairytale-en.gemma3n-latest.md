Beyond the Apple Meadows in a small village tucked into soft, Greenhills lived Lenny, a girl with bright red curly hair that shimmered like copper thread in the sun when the wind danced through her curls; it looked as if a tiny friendly fire was laughing. Her best friend was Tap, a little furry ant with courage far bigger than any boot; he lived in a mossy teacup beside Lenny's windowsill and spent his days scouting the world for the next great... When a sudden evening, they reached Whisper Hill. It didn't speak out loud, only softly straight into the heart. Lenny didn't wish for treasure. She wished for roads that never truly end. Tap wished that Lenny's laughter would always feel like the way home, and when they walked back, the world wasn't bigger, just kinda because their friendship had grown strong enough to carry them step-by-step further than any map ever could.
