When beaming arrived, we smiled first. That kind of smile that says: Finally, the world is practical. No waiting. No delays. No red-eye flights, no aching legs in unfamiliar seats, no goodbyes stretched thin by distance.

And then—quietly, almost politely—“practical” became something else.

Beaming didn’t just shorten travel. It erased the in-between. The space where you used to breathe. The stretch of time where you could rethink the text you were about to send, the argument you were about to start, the decision you were about to make. Distance used to protect you. Not from other people—from yourself. From impulse. From the sharp, immediate “I have to be there right now,” even when what you really needed was a minute to cool down.

Now there is no later. There’s only: here—and instantly there.

At first, it was beautiful. Truly. Imagine hugging someone you love without planning, without counting days, without that dull ache of waiting. Help doesn’t arrive “soon,” it arrives now. Medicine. Rescue. A hand on your shoulder. For a while, the world felt like it had finally learned compassion.

But every kind of salvation takes something with it. Not out of cruelty. Just because the price is always hiding somewhere.

Because when everything is possible all the time, possibility loses its weight. When you can be anywhere in a heartbeat, “somewhere else” starts to feel less like a place and more like a pin on a map. Cities become backdrops. Countries become settings. And longing—real longing, that bright force that used to pull us across oceans—doesn’t know where to land anymore.

Sometimes I think we won the world and misplaced our sense of wonder.

And relationships… relationships changed the most.

Closeness used to cost something. Time. Effort. Commitment. You didn’t just show up—you meant it. Now closeness is a tap. And a tap is fast. Too fast to stay sacred.

You can always “just pop over.” And that phrase—just—does something to the soul. Visits start to feel like options instead of offerings. Like calendar items instead of vows. And the people you love can end up feeling both near and somehow… not fully held.

We’ve been everywhere. And we’re still, somehow, not always present.

Home changed too. Home used to be where you arrived. Where the day ended. Where your body unclenched. Now it can feel like a charging station. In, out, in again. Constant motion with no real landing. And one day you notice: you’re rarely far away, but you’re also rarely fully here.

There’s another shift we don’t like to admit: the less distance we have, the louder the hunger for boundaries becomes. Not always walls you can see. Often rules you can’t. Permissions. IDs. Data gates. When deserts and oceans stop filtering movement, control simply changes shape. It turns invisible. And invisible control makes people nervous, because you can’t point to it, you can’t fight it, you can’t even name it cleanly.

That might be the strangest irony: we defeated distance, but uncertainty didn’t leave. It just moved into the wiring.

I don’t think beaming made us worse. I think it made us faster than our hearts can follow. And at that speed, everything shows. Our impatience. Our addiction to convenience. Our fear of silence.

Because silence used to live on the way there. On trains. In airports. In long drives. Now, if you want silence, you have to choose it. And choosing it is harder than people think.

Maybe that’s the real work of this new world: bringing back the in-between. Not as miles, but as a practice.

A deliberate pause. A chosen delay. A moment where you don’t jump—not because you can’t, but because you know that always jumping steals something you’ll miss later, even if you can’t explain what it was.

Maybe luxury won’t be being able to go anywhere.

Maybe luxury will be not having to.

To stay. To actually stay. To let a moment be heavy enough to matter.

Not because you couldn’t beam.

Because you didn’t want to.

And maybe that’s the point where beaming stops running our lives—and starts serving them.
